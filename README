This is my attempt to build Mongo for ARM support in Raspberry Pi 2 in Raspian.

Steps for the build:
  1. Install GCC 4.9 as it is needed for building. You may refer (https://solarianprogrammer.com/2015/01/13/raspberry-pi-raspbian-install-gcc-compile-cpp-14-programs/)
  2. Change the default g++ and gcc to use 4.9 instead of the default 4.6.
  3. Clone the repository and build it.
  
Changes I made to the sources are mainly merge arm support from the original V8, disable wired-tiger (as not supported for 32bit arch) and use hard float by default.
I'm pretty new to this so any comments and improvements are welcome.
